# MemoryMap

Store journal entries and associated photos in an interactive map
- create new "memories" associated with a location, journal entry, images, and key words
- assign "memories" to different groups, to organize your adventures
- create connections between different "memories" to show your adventures in a chronological manner
- (optionally) set a time to receive daily notifications reminding you of a random "memory"
